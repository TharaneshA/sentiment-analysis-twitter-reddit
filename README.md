## Model Information

This project utilizes the following Hugging Face transformer models for sentiment analysis:

- Model: [distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english)
  - A lightweight and efficient model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis
  - Provides binary sentiment classification (positive/negative)
  - Achieves good balance between performance and computational efficiency

## How It Works

The app makes it super easy to understand what people are saying about any topic on social media. Here's how you can use it:

1. First, head over to `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser
2. Log in with either your Twitter or Reddit account - don't worry, we keep your data safe!
3. Once you're in, just type any keyword or topic you're interested in (like "iPhone 15" or "Taylor Swift")
4. The app will then:
   - Find trending posts and discussions about your topic from Twitter and Reddit
   - Analyze the sentiment of each post using our AI model
   - Show you easy-to-understand results with sentiment scores

### Understanding the Results

For each post or comment, you'll see:
- The original text content
- A sentiment score (ranging from 0 to 100)
  - Scores closer to 1 mean very positive sentiment
  - Scores around 50 are neutral
  - Scores closer to 0 indicate negative sentiment
- Visual indicators (like üòä or ‚òπÔ∏è) to make it easy to understand at a glance

### Example Use Cases

- Brand Monitoring: Track public sentiment about your product or brand
- Event Impact: See how people feel about recent events or announcements
- Competitive Analysis: Compare sentiment between different brands or products
- Trend Analysis: Monitor how public opinion changes over time
